                            A: I'm actually doing quite well, or at least I think I am. Some of my classmates actually ask me about things like quizzes because of that, 
                            and they even ask for help in projects and other activities. <br><br>
                            <font color="#387be8">Q: What are your hobbies outside of school?</font><br>
                            A: Outside of school, most of the time I play video games since they are very entertaining and can sometimes be challenging. 
                            Other than that, I also like to read novels either online or physically.
                            When I get outside, I also tend to go people watching, or observe the people around me and watch what they are doing. <br><br>
                            <font color="#387be8">Q: What do you want to become in the future?</font><br>
                            A: Honestly, I don't really know as of yet. While I can think of many different occupations or jobs that I can go to, I haven't 
                            really decided on a good one yet, and it's not very easy to choose one when most of the choices are good.
