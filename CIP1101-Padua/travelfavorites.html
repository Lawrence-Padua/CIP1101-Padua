                    <h2 align="left">Tagaytay</h2>
                    <p align="left"> Tagaytay, as a place with a higher elevation, has a colder climate than other cities, and provides a nice view of the surroundings including Taal Volcano. 
                        It also has tourist attractions like the Sky Ranch, and local delicacies such as the bulalo, which you should definitely try as the heat it provides complements the cold outside.</p>

                    <h2 align="right">SM North Edsa</h2>
                    <p align="right">This place is one of my favorites as it is closer than other destinations and this mall in particular is more memorable to me than others. Me and my family used to watch movies in theaters in this mall, and after that we would take a stroll around to see what we could find.</p>
