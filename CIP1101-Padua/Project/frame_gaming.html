                            When I was young, I used to play MMORPGs with my dad. I don't play those kinds of games now since they are very time consuming. Part of why I play video games is because of the story, since I also love reading and getting immersed in fictional worlds.
                            <br><br>Now, I mostly play rhythm games, as it combines listening to music with playing games, and the music is so good that it changed my music taste. It can also get very difficult at higher levels, and it feels very satisfying clearing something difficult.
