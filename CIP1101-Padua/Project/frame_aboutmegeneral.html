                            Hello! I am Lawrence Jayce Padua, an IT student currently studying at University of the East-Caloocan. I am also currently 19 years old. While it may not look like it, I am actually very friendly, and can get along well with everyone. Some of my classmates even come to me for help with activities. However, I can sometimes be a perfectionist and tend to overthink things, leading to me being indecisive sometimes. <br><br> I also have a tendency to procrastinate. A lot.
