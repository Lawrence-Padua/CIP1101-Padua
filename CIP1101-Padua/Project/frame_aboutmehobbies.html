                            I have some hobbies, but most of the time, you can see me playing video games. I consider myself pretty good at them, with the exception of shooter and fighting games.
                            <br><br> I like to share my hobbies and interests with my friends, although sometimes I hesitate because I think about if they like them too, and other things.
                            <br><br> Check out the Interests page for more in-depth information about my hobbies and interests!
