                            The theme I have chosen for this website is the sky, as shown with the blue and white color scheme. The sky above is vast, and when I look at it, I am always amazed by its greatness, especially when combined with the sun or moon. There is also a saying "The sky's the limit", meaning that we should always be ambitious, as we have the potential to achieve great things.
