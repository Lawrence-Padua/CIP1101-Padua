                            One of my secrets is whenever I am idle or doing pretty much nothing, I tend to get lost in my thoughts, where I think about random things, and I can even listen to music without anything playing.
                            <br><br> Due to my curiosity, I also like to check what the people around me are doing, looking to see if they are doing anything interesting. I keep everything I see a secret, to keep things private.
