                        As of now, I have only travelled to different places with my family and other relatives, where we went to hotels, beaches and such for swimming. We would plan our trip a week ahead and pack our stuff the day before the trip.
                        <br><br> As for other people whom I want to travel with, It would be my friends that I would choose. While we had some meetups at some places like malls in the past, It would be nice to have to go on a trip to somewhere far away, and experience the sights with them.
