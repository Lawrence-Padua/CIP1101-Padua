                        <b>Hello!</b> I do stuff. I tend to come to class early to watch what my other classmates do in their free time, or do some things myself if there are activities.
                        Some of my classmates usually ask me about the activities for that day since they know me as the smart person in the class, though there are others better
                        than me, and I don't really like them calling me that since anyone who tries hard enough can do the same. I tend to be in good terms with my classmates,
                        although it makes it hard in group activities sometimes as many want me in their group and I am also indecisive. <br><br>
                        When I do stuff like projects and activities on my own, I tend to take more time than usual since I sometimes overthink and check things a lot of times, and everything I do is usually final.
                        I also sometimes get distracted especially when at home, which adds more time. On the other hand, I speed through most objective type questions, since they usually have
                        only 1 answer and there is less time needed to think about it. <hr width="85%" color="#000000"><br>
